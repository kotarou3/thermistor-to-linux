# Each thermistor (R_THERn) is configured in the following topology:
#     1V <-- R1 (1500Ω) -- THERn -- R2 (390Ω) -- R_THERn --| GND
#
# The MAX6698 measures the voltage between THERn and the 1V rail, and reports
# it as a fixed-point value in temp5~temp7, such that (tempn / 200) is the
# measured voltage. This means that each LSB indicates 5mV.
#
# The R1 and R2 resistances were chosen such that when the fixed-point values
# are read as plain Celcius integers (as libsensors does without extra
# configuration), they are within 1°C accurate between 25°C~55°C, for a
# thermistor of R0=10kΩ, T0=25°C, B=3435K.
#
# However, to gain more accuracy, we have to take the non-linearities of a
# thermistor into account, and calculate the actual temperature from the voltage
# reading:
#     Vn = tempn / 200
#     R_THERn = R1 / Vn - R1 - R2
#     Rinf = R0 * exp(-B / T0)
#     Tn = B / ln(R_THERn / Rinf) - 273.15K
